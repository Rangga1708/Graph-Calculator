# Graph Calculator
Hello everyone. So this is an open source GUI graph calculator, created with Python, using Tkinter and Sympy. I call it Graph Calculator. Simple right? To make it short, just call it GC. Though it's not as good as other paid graph calculator, it's still worth to use it.  

There are several files in this repository.

## 1. Graph Calculator.exe
This is the executable file. I'm sorry I have a trouble in pushing my repo from local to remote so I put the exe file [here][https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uW5DIvkz52d5Sk4JRglUw4Be8pwc0xFb?usp=sharing] in my drive. Just download it from there. You don't even need to install anything. It's a portable version.

## 2. graph_calculator.py
This is the python code of this software. If you're familiar with Python, feel free to edit it and even develop it as you want.

## 3. Graph Calculator Manual.pdf
I wrote the manual about how to use GC here. Please read it first before you start using.

## 4. Graph Calculator Manual.docx
Well this is just the doc version of the Graph Calculator Manual.pdf. Maybe you want to edit it or something.

## 5. Features Under Development.txt
I list all the features that I currently developing here. 

## 6. README.md
Well if ypu have read this far, those are the inside of the readme.md XD.

I hope this software will be useful for us all. Please, feel free to comment and give any suggestions you want to make this calculator better. Enjoy it ;)
